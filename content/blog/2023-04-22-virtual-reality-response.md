As you probably could have told [my last blog post](./2023-04-19-virtual-reality) was created for a project for my writing course... after all, name me one *normal* person who cites their sources with DOIs in a blog post.

With that, feedback was given and questions were asked, and a few of them interesting enough to answer myself. Since no one in the history of ever in that class has ever actually answered feedback questions by replying to the post, I thought I would throw them here.

## Wishes and Questions

> One question I have Is why did this topic stand out to you so broad and not something directly related just like virtual reality in school. I wish you would have touched over some bad things virtual reality brings to us, (maybe lack of social skills) or something along those lines.

> ... One thing I would've wished you could've incorporated into the blog was where virtual reality was going in the near future and even continue with what sectors virtual reality should be or can be added to. One thing I was wondering throughout the blog was do you see yourself going to be apart of the advancement of virtual reality? and what would this advancement look like in your eyes?

> ... One thing I wish is that you spent a little more time introducing what virtual reality is. However, I'll say that I had to search for something to wish for, so it was not bad by any means! Finally, how did you learn to create things of this sort and to such a professional looking degree?
