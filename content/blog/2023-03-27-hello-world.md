A short blog post to start out with. As explained on the landing page, this website was built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and a [Blogster](https://github.com/flexdinesh/blogster) template. I loved the way this template had the "highlighted" effect on the landing page just as [my website](http://hunterparcells.com/) does.

This is the first time I'm using Astro after my good friend [Dave](https://paperdave.net) had convinced me to try it out a month or so back. So far, I'm pretty impressed with its DX, and I'm exited to see where I can extend it. I just can't get used to using `.astro` files and its syntax.

I've been using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for a while now (previously [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com)) so that's what just feels familiar for me. I don't think I'll ever fully switch to something like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), but it's always fun to try new things.

If you want more frequent updates, check out my [Twitter page](https://twitter.com/hunterparcells). I've been bogged down with school recently, but expect more posts here soon!
