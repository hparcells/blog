What's the most useful tool you own? Your phone? A laptop? These devices do provide us with a nearly infinite stream of information and knowledge, but there is a device, virtual reality, that can do all that and so much more. Behind the plastic goggles is a place where you can do nearly anything. Play games, watch movies, meditate, join chat rooms, exercise, explore the world, you name it.

Specifically, I am talking about *immersive* virtual reality (IVR), the type of virtual reality provided by headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, and others... just to name a few. These products have become more and more popular as they have become more affordable and more content has been published for them.

When mainstream virtual reality once became popular, there was [doubt and concern cast upon the technology](https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/13/health/virtual-reality-vr-dangers-safety/). There were many concerns about the adverse side effects, both physically and socially. Even [online forums](https://reddit.com/r/VRtoER) were opened, dedicated to only posting photos and videos of people injuring themselves while using virtual reality. These critics did have a good reason to be concerned though. Virtual reality offered a place where you could escape the world, talk with people on the other side of the planet, and was host to countless streams of entertainment.

However, virtual reality can be used for more than just entertainment.

- Technology usage has become a staple in public education, and schools have moved to adopt new ways to use technology in the classroom such as iPads or laptops. And now, virtual reality can offer unique and valuable benefits to students and educators alike.
- Nowadays, companies and businesses struggle to keep up with the pace that technology is evolving. With the growing use of virtual reality, companies may be able to utilize the benefits that virtual reality offers.
- Senior living arrangements may able to raise the quality of life of their residents, as well as better care for dementia patients.

## Virtual Reality in the Classroom

Almost from the **very beginning** of my education, technology has always been present. At the very very start, we only had one computer lab in the school. We got to play around on them using a program called KidPix, which is somehow still around today. It was back when software was installed using discs.

Then we were able to use laptops for an hour at a time, making Word documents for poems and bullet-point research reports. Then we learned touch-typing, with the rubber keyboard covers to make us memorize the keyboard, which my peers *may or may not have cheated at*.

We also got to see digital whiteboard to slowly roll into a few classrooms, still being projector based, but using "fake" whiteboard pens and erasers.

**Through middle school**, we had received personal iPads and were able to use desktop computers across the school, writing essays, making presentations, and editing photos. Through a few lessons, we were able to use [Google Cardboard](https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/) to explore historical landmarks, though it was never truly "immersive."

**In high school** almost everyone owned a laptop or a phone, and was able to create well-developed essays, websites, and more. Research was done more professionally in preparation for college.

Teachers embraced the new technology, resources and assignments was almost exclusively ran online, having assignments being required to be turned in online. This was further amplified throughout the pandemic, where everyone had to transition to an online learning environment.

Virtual whiteboards got an upgrade, no longer needing a projector with the capabilities of being connected to the internet.

What about **right now**? In college, creating a *blog post* for an assignment, where some classes are held completely online, where we can have "face-to-face" conversations in another language with people across the world in real-time.

In my 13 years of K-12 education, I have seen iPads, laptops, even *digital whiteboards* being used in the classroom, but what's next for the new generation of students starting their educational career? What kind of technology will they be able to experience? Artificial intelligence (ChatGPT)? Holograms? But what about... virtual reality?

### Research

Di Natale, in her [10-year systemic review](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13030), included study involving a large group of seventh graders learning a new math concept (*quadratic equations, yuck*), where the virtual reality group learned by *gameifying* the lesson.

A week later, a post-test was given and the virtual reality group had shown great improvement, but not those in the control group. These conclusions show that the use of virtual reality can deepen understanding academically which results in higher exam scores, but another way virtual reality can help academically is through meditation.

[A study](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2582481804/abstract/7162FC29C59C4297PQ/1) conducted by Regina Kaplan-Rakowski and her team found **that meditation using virtual reality had significantly reduced levels of stress and anxiety**, which could lead to an increase in academic performance.

The majority of students had asserted that meditation to be helpful and that the use of **virtual reality meditation had helped them achieve better scores on the exam**.

These kind of benefits are the things students are yearning for. Just during the pandemic, [more than one in every three students had claimed that their mental health was not good during the pandemic](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/04/25/in-cdc-survey-37-of-u-s-high-school-students-report-regular-mental-health-struggles-during-covid-19/) including stress, anxiety, and depression. Research still suggests that students have not recovered yet.

If virtual reality can help students achieve not just better exam scores, but better understanding of the subjects at hand, and if virtual reality can relieve stress and anxiety from students, educators and board members should highly consider adopting this new and upcoming technology.

## Virtual Reality in the Workspace

Boosting productivity is a key factor in any organization's decisions.

Some companies may have invested in robots, who can do repetitive and straining tasks over and over without mistakes, and more importantly, without needing a break or getting paid. Some companies try to automate many portions of their business, such as restaurants creating a website for customers to order online, where employees no longer need to spend their time taking orders over the counter or over the phone, which is wages coming out of the business's pocket.

Because of this, we have seen the rise of services such as DoorDash and Uber Eats which provide delivery services to businesses and restaurants that may not be able to afford their own in-house delivery team.

What many occupations have done is providing multiple monitors to their employees for their computers. Many desk jobs have two to three. Air traffic controllers, a job known for needing immense multitasking skills, often work with four or five. 911 operators might even go as far as to use up to *eight*.
