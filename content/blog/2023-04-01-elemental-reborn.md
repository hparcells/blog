> Yet another Elemental 3 clone. Combine elements to make more elements.

Elemental Reborn was a web game I had created in the summer of 2020, inspired by two things:
1. [carykh](https://www.youtube.com/user/carykh)'s third installment of his Elemental games, [Elemental 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J10KDPg_Im0) after it was shut down due to scaling issues.
2. [paperdave](https://paperdave.net/)'s take on Elemental 3: [Elemental 4](https://github.com/paperdave/elemental4), *which has also been shutdown*.

It quickly became one of my most popular projects after the hype within the [Elemental Discord](https://discord.gg/X9VyN42) following the release of Elemental 4. I originally took up the project as a challenge to see how hard it would be to make an Elemental-type game.

Turns out? Pretty easy.

## Elemental?

Elemental type games all share one core gameplay loop. Everyone starts with four core elements, typically **Air, Earth, Fire, and Water**. Combinations of these elements create new elements, such as Air and Earth creating Dust, or Earth and Earth creating a Hill.

Community interaction peaked, as players asked each other how to attain certain elements. More complex elements got neat "tree recipes" which describe how to attain the element.

## The History of Elemental

Elemental was a web experiment created back in 2011 hosted on [https://htwins.net/](https://htwins.net/). With 65 predefined elements, it was quite small. Elemental 2 was released later during 2016, ending up 219 elements, before Adobe Flash Player was declared dead.

There was one problem though. The elements in these games had to be created by the developer, that is Cary Huang. In Elemental 3, also released in 2016, elements were able to be created by anyone.

Elements went through a suggestion and **voting process**. Users, when encountering an element combination that doesn't exist yet, can suggest a new element. When other users encounter the same combination, they can either suggest their own, or vote on a number of existing suggestions. If a suggestion gets enough votes, it gets added to the game for everyone else to find. You even get credit with a so called "Pioneer's Note."

On September 13th, 2020, Elemental 3 was shut down after scaling issues and poorly written code. In the end, 27,221 unique elements were created.
